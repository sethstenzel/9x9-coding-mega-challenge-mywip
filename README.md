# 9x9 Coding Mega Challenge!
81 programs closer to being a superstar programmer. Think you have what it takes?

Create 9 feature-rich applications in 9 different languages.

You are welcome to choose whatever languages you wish, however, this challenge was created with the following 9 languages in mind.
Python
Javascript
Java
C#
Go
C
C++
Rust
Assembly (ASM)

# But why?
Because I like setting large goals and doing this well will give me (and maybe you) a bit of self-validation, as well as massive insight into multiple languages and ways of implementing solutions.
If I (or you) can create this, in 9 different languages, I/You can do anything **#flex** with just a few fingers and a keyboard.

# The Applications to be created:
1. A simplified Calculator (CLI) with history. This should include all four general operations as well as square root, and exponent multiplication. Additionally a results history and recall should be implemented.
2. URL Shortener (API) with storage implementation
3. TODO List with real-time tracking
4. Snake Game with player name high scores
5. Stateless API-based Calculator
6. Virtual Piano with recorded playback
7. Sudoku Solver
8. Current Rate Currency convertor with TUI
9. File Compression Utility
